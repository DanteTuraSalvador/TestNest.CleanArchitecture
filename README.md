**This API serves as a demonstration and educational resource for showcasing modern API development practices using .NET and Domain-Driven Design principles.** It provides a comprehensive set of endpoints for managing resources. It follows RESTful principles to ensure a predictable and easy-to-use interface for developers and utilizes a **Service-Based Implementation**.

## Key Features and Design Patterns

## Key Features and Design Patterns

* **Resource Management:** Offers full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for key entities within the application, with business logic encapsulated within dedicated **Services**.
* **Service-Based Implementation:** The API employs a service layer (e.g., `IEmployeeRoleService`) that contains the core business logic, separating it from the controller's responsibility of handling HTTP requests and responses. This promotes better organization, testability, and maintainability.
* **Rich Domain Model with Value Objects:** The API leverages a rich domain model where entities encapsulate behavior and data. It also utilizes **Value Objects** to represent immutable domain concepts (e.g., email addresses, phone numbers, monetary values), promoting better domain modeling and reducing the risk of inconsistencies. **Domain tests** ensure the integrity and behavior of these core domain components.
* **Automatic Data Seeding with Bogus:** The application automatically populates the database with realistic sample data on startup using the **Bogus** library, facilitating development and testing.
* **Data Validation:** Implements robust server-side validation within the service layer (and potentially using middleware in the API) to ensure data integrity and provide informative error messages for invalid requests, potentially utilizing **Guard Clauses** for early exit and clear validation logic.
* **Error Handling:** Provides consistent and structured error responses using standard HTTP status codes and `ProblemDetails` for easier debugging and integration, often leveraging a **Result Pattern** (`Result<T>`) to encapsulate operation outcomes with potential errors returned from the service layer.
* **Asynchronous Operations:** Built with asynchronous operations throughout the API and service layer for improved performance and scalability.
* **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs):** Utilizes DTOs to define clear contracts for request and response payloads, facilitating data transfer between the API and the service layer.
* **Efficient Custom Data Mapping:** Leverages a custom mapping for streamlined object transformations between DTOs and domain entities (including **Value Objects**) within the service layer.
* **Well-Documented:** Designed with API documentation in mind, making it easy for developers to understand and integrate (likely using Swagger/OpenAPI).
* **Pagination (for Collections):** Supports retrieving large datasets in manageable chunks with pagination parameters handled by the service layer and reflected in the API response.
* **Filtering and Sorting (for Collections):** Offers options to filter and sort collections of resources, with the filtering and sorting logic often implemented using the **Specification Pattern** within the service layer to encapsulate query logic.
* **HATEOAS (for Collection Endpoints):** Implements Hypermedia links in collection responses to enable discoverability of related resources and navigation, often generated within the controller based on data from the service layer.
* **Strongly-Typed IDs (Potentially):** Employs strongly-typed IDs for enhanced type safety and domain clarity, used consistently throughout the API and service layer, potentially as **Value Objects**. **Shared library tests** verify the functionality of these common types.
* **Domain-Driven Design (Inspired):** Organized with a focus on the domain, separating concerns and encapsulating business logic within the **Service-Based Implementation** and a rich domain model with **Value Objects**, likely interacting with data through **Repositories** for persistence abstraction managed by a **Unit of Work** pattern within the service layer. **Architectural tests** ensure adherence to these design principles and layer separation, often leveraging libraries like **ArchUnitNET** and **ArchUnitNET.xUnit**.
* **Comprehensive Testing Strategy:** Features a multi-layered testing approach, utilizing frameworks like **xUnit** and **Moq** for unit and integration tests, and **ArchUnitNET** and **ArchUnitNET.xUnit** for architectural validation:
    * **Domain Tests:** Validating the behavior and rules of the core domain entities and value objects.
    * **Application Service Tests:** Ensuring the business logic within the service layer functions correctly, often through mocking dependencies using **Moq**.
    * **Repository Tests:** Verifying the data access layer's interaction with the database.
    * **Shared Library Tests:** Confirming the functionality of common utilities and types.
    * **Architectural Tests:** Enforcing the intended structure and dependencies between different parts of the application using **ArchUnitNET** and **ArchUnitNET.xUnit**.
* **Containerized Database with Docker:** Includes Docker configuration to easily set up and run the application's database, simplifying the development environment setup.

## How to Run

1.  **Ensure Docker Desktop is running on your machine.** The application is configured to use a containerized database.
2.  **Open the solution (.sln file) in Visual Studio.**
3.  **Press F5 (or select Debug > Start Debugging).** Visual Studio will automatically build the project, run the Docker Compose configuration (starting the database), apply database migrations on startup, seed the database with sample data using Bogus, and launch the API in your default browser or a designated port.
